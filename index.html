			<p> Hi, I'm Mya. I'm fourteen. I love to sing, read, act, and play soccer. My favorite place to go is Disney World. My favorite food is bacon cheeseburgers. I have two younger brothers.  </p>

			<p> I have been in two musicals, "Peter Pan Jr." and "Annie Jr." In "Peter Pan Jr" I was Chief Tiger Bamboo (see above). In "Annie Jr.", I was Miss Hannigan. My favorite role I've ever played (so far) was probably Miss Hannigan. </p>

In the picture to the right, I am smiling with my younger cousin, Lillian, at my Aunt Bess's and Uncle David's wedding. </p>

			<p> This is a picture of my soccer team. I have been playing soccer since I was six, and here is a picture of me and my team at practice one day where there was a double rainbow. I am in the center, wearing light blue and a white headband. Our team's name is the Angels, and I play center midfield, although my favorite postition is right foreward. </p>

			<h class=brown> Tower of Terror </h>
			<!-- TODO: Add a paragraph to describe the image -->
			<p> This is a picture of me, taken in December of 2017, in front of my favorite ride at Disney World, titled Tower of Terror, located in Disney's Hollywood Studios. The ride takes place in Hollywood in 1939. A child actress, her nanny, a bellhop, and a prominent acting couple traveled in a doomed elevator. A lighting attack struck when these six people were in the elevator shaft, immediately killing these unlucky six, who became ghosts and haunt the hotel. The hotel closed down after this nightmare. When you enter the ride, you find yourself in the old hotel, in the same elevator shaft that they were in when they were killed. You are dropped up and down in the same elevator. Once, I rode this seven times in a row! I love this ride.  </p>
